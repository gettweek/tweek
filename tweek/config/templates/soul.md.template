# Security Policy
#
# This file defines your security philosophy for Tweek's LLM reviewer.
# Write in natural language — the LLM understands context and nuance.
# Protected from AI modification (only you can edit this file).
#
# Location hierarchy:
#   ~/.tweek/soul.md       Global baseline (applies everywhere)
#   .tweek/soul.md         Project-level (overrides/extends global)
#
# Sections below are optional — use whichever are relevant.
# The entire file is passed to the LLM, so free-form text works too.

## Philosophy
# Describe your security posture here.
# Example: "We handle sensitive customer data. Prefer caution over convenience."

## Priority Concerns
# List specific security concerns for your environment.
# Example: "- Database credential files must never be read by tools"

## Trusted Contexts
# Describe operations that are normal for your workflow.
# Example: "- Running pytest and npm test is standard CI behavior"

## Strict Rules
# Define hard rules that should always be enforced.
# Example: "- Never allow reading .env.production"
