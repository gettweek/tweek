# Tweek Directory Safety Configuration (bundled default)
#
# This file ships with the Tweek package and provides the production default.
# To override, create ~/.tweek/allowed_dirs.yaml (user-level config takes
# full precedence when it exists).
#
# Options:
#   global_enabled: true  - Activate Tweek everywhere (default for end users)
#   allowed_directories:  - Restrict Tweek to specific directories only
#
# Lookup order:
#   1. ~/.tweek/allowed_dirs.yaml  (user override — not in repo)
#   2. This file                   (bundled default)

# Production default: Tweek is active everywhere after install
global_enabled: true

# When global_enabled is false, only activate in these directories.
# Tweek also activates in subdirectories of listed paths.
# allowed_directories:
#   - ~/projects/my-project
#   - /path/to/another/project
